## Speaking Section

### Question One – Independent Speaking
TOEFL Speaking Question 1 is the independent TOEFL speaking question.  It’s also called the “personal choice” question.  You’ll give your opinion on a subject likely related to school, work, or some other part of life.

This question asks if you agree or disagree with a given statement.  That might look like this:

* “State whether you agree or disagree with the following statement. Then, explain your reasons using specific details in your argument. Teachers should assign daily homework to students.”

Sometimes, the question requires you to pick between two opposing options.  In that case, it will look something like this:

* “There are many different approaches to academic studies, all of which have specific benefits. Do you prefer to study for tests in a group or to study alone? Include details and examples to support your explanation.”

Lastly, you might get a question that refers to a hypothetical situation.  These questions are rare.  They look like this:

* “Some companies have rules that forbid employees from using personal cell phones during working hours. Do you think this is a good idea? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.”
